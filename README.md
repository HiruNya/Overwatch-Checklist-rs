# Overwatch-Checklist-rs
An Overwatch Checklist built in Rust using Conrod.

32 and 64-bit versions available however the 32-bit has not been tested on a 32-bit machine.

The console shows up alongside the main window. I'm not sure as to how I would remove this from showing up, if you have any suggestions - please let me know!
